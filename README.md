📖 Chapter 4: Data Structures, Collections, and Multithreading
🔹 Topics Covered:

ArrayList and its use for managing employee details
Collection interface for storing and retrieving objects
Multithreading concepts, synchronization, and thread priorities
📝 Problem Statements

✅ Problem 1: Employee Management System (Easy Level)
Description:
Develop a Java program using ArrayList to manage employee details such as ID, Name, and Salary. Allow users to add, update, remove, and search for employee information.
Example Input:

Enter employee ID: 101
Enter employee Name: John Doe
Enter employee Salary: 55000.00
Example Output:

Employee added: ID=101, Name=John Doe, Salary=55000.00
✅ Problem 2: Card Collection System (Medium Level)
Description:
Create a program to collect and store cards using the Collection interface. The program should assist users in finding all the cards that belong to a given symbol (e.g., Hearts, Spades, etc.).
Example Input:

Enter the symbol: Hearts
Example Output:

Cards in Hearts: [2 of Hearts, 5 of Hearts, Ace of Hearts]
✅ Problem 3: Ticket Booking System (Hard Level)
Description:
Develop a ticket booking system where users can book seats for an event. Ensure that no seat can be double-booked using synchronized threads. Implement thread priorities to simulate VIP bookings being processed first.
Example Input:

VIP customer trying to book seat number: 5
Regular customer trying to book seat number: 3
Example Output:

VIP customer successfully booked seat 5.
Regular customer successfully booked seat 3.
